# Main.gd Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Code Organization**
- Added clear section headers with comment blocks for easy navigation
- Grouped related functions together:
  - Game Constants
  - Game State Management  
  - Exported Variables
  - Private Variables
  - Initialization
  - Input Handling
  - Visual Effects Setup
  - Entity Management
  - Visual Effects
  - Signal Handlers

### 2. **Constants and Magic Numbers**
- Extracted all magic numbers to named constants at the top
- Added color constants for visual effects
- Made the code more maintainable and self-documenting

### 3. **Function Decomposition**
- Broke down large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions
- `setup_visual_effects()` → multiple smaller functions
- `create_grid_background()` → split into logical parts
- State setup functions → separated concerns

### 4. **Improved Naming**
- Made all internal functions private with `_` prefix
- Used more descriptive function names
- Better variable typing and naming

### 5. **Dead Code Removal**
- Removed commented out `#clear_mobs_flash_screen()` line
- Removed unused print statements
- Cleaned up redundant comments

### 6. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- Visual effects setup separated from game logic
- State management isolated
- Signal handling centralized
- Entity management grouped

### 7. **Consistency Improvements**
- Consistent function structure
- Consistent parameter ordering
- Consistent code style throughout

## Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Readability**: Clear sections and naming make code self-documenting
- **Testability**: Smaller functions are easier to test and debug
- **Extensibility**: Adding new features is more straightforward
- **Performance**: No performance impact, just better organization

## File Structure
- **main_backup.gd**: Original version for reference
- **main.gd**: Refactored version (current)
