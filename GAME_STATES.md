# Game State System Implementation

## 🎮 Game States Added:

### **START_SCREEN**
- Shows title and "Press SPACE/ENTER to Start"
- Player centered, all systems paused
- Clean slate for new game

### **PLAYING** 
- All game systems active
- Timers running, mobs spawning
- Normal gameplay state

### **GAME_OVER**
- Triggered when player hit by mob
- Shows survival time and restart message
- Red death flash effect
- All systems paused

## 🏗️ Best Practices Implemented:

### **1. State Machine Pattern**
```gdscript
enum GameState { START_SCREEN, PLAYING, GAME_OVER }
func change_state(new_state) -> void:
    current_state = new_state
    # Handle state-specific setup
```

### **2. State-Guarded Functions**
```gdscript
func _on_player_hit() -> void:
    if current_state == GameState.PLAYING:
        change_state(GameState.GAME_OVER)
```

### **3. Clean State Transitions**
- Each state has its own setup function
- Proper cleanup when changing states
- Visual feedback for state changes

### **4. Input Handling**
- Context-sensitive input (different per state)
- Consistent controls (SPACE/ENTER)

## 🎯 User Flow:
1. **Game starts** → START_SCREEN
2. **Press SPACE** → PLAYING state
3. **Get hit by mob** → GAME_OVER state  
4. **Press SPACE** → Direct restart to PLAYING state (better UX!)

## 💡 Professional Game Development:
This is exactly how commercial games handle states!
- Menus, gameplay, pause screens all use state machines
- Makes the code predictable and bug-free
- Easy to add new states (pause, settings, etc.)
